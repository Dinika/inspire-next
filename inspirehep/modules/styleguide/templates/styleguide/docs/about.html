<p>Welcome to the INSPIRE Labs Style Guide. Below you can find most of Bootstrap's components and their appearance with INSPIRE's stylesheets.</p>

<p>Before you start your front-end development, make sure you become familiar with:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">Bootstrap's CSS</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/components/">Bootstrap's Components</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates">Jinja2 templates</a></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
And read the <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Inspire/InspireDesignPrinciples">UX/UI principles for INSPIRE</a>
</p>
<p>
Use these components in your future developments and contact the <a href="mailto:inspire-usability@cern.ch">INSPIRE usability team</a> if you think some changes are needed.
